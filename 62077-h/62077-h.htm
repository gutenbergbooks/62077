Robbinsdale, Minn.</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Sir:</p>

<p>On September 27th our train #12 was held at Robbinsdale
37 minutes loading what is stated to have been 36,000 lbs. of mail.
In order that provision be made to handle such large quantities of mail
without causing unreasonable delay to trains, would you kindly furnish
the following information:</p>

<p>First, Frequency of publication of the magazine.</p>

<p>Second, Days or dates when regularly due to be placed in the mail.</p>

<p>Third, Approximate weight or number of copies of each issue.</p>

<p>With this information we will consider the making of
some special arrangement for bringing to the cities. It might be
advantageous to set a baggage car out at Robbinsdale the day before
the magazine due to be forwarded.</p>

<p class="center">Yours truly</p>

<p class="right">M. J. Woulfe</p>

</div>

<p>The letter tells the story!</p>

<p>If our Winter Annuals had been loaded at one time Captain
Billy would have filled an entire mail train. Hereafter,
Gentle Reader, your news dealer will have the Whiz
Bang on the 15th of the month, and because of our enormous
orders, we will, in future, mail a few truck loads
every day throughout the full month, all magazines to be
held at the various postoffices until the 15th for delivery.
In conclusion, I thank you for your indulgence at delays
in getting your Whiz Bang and your Winter Annual. The
old Whiz Bang Farm has been a busy spot these past few
months. Yours for fun,</p>

<p class="right">CAPTAIN BILLY.</p>

<h2><i>Drippings From the Fawcett</i></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">It is a long jump from a one-horse town
like Robbinsdale to the land of deciduous
fruits, forbidden fruits, fruitless fruits,
movie stars, reformers, abilone cuff links, outdoor
plumbing and all-night burglar service—meaning
California, of course.</p>

<p>I am at this writing occupying a room in
that well known San Francisco hostelry which
“Fatty” Arbuckle tried to convert into an ice-house.
The only kick I have against the St.
Francis is that the room clerk assigned me to
twin beds. Being of a bullsheviki theosophical
frame of mind and also very lonesome, I moved
the other twin alongside my twin and slept
soundly ever after.</p>

<p>Lolled around for two weeks at the Alexandria,
in Los Angeles, and before that at a
hotel at Coronado that fairly “oozed” hospitality,
although older than the handles on
Solomon’s wheelbarrow.</p>

<p>There is an ancient quip about the three
divisions of liars—plain liars, d—— liars and
Native Sons. Also there used to be one that
went something like this: “The miners came
in ’49 and the janes in ’51,” etc., etc. But they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
are both all wrong. Despite what Gus’ brother
said about Robbinsdale not being a one-horse
town after he had spent a week wearing the
“white wing” vestments, I am willing to admit
that Los Angeles and San Francisco have
opened the eyes of an inquisitive farmer from
the aforesaid Robbinsdale.</p>

<p>They seem to have everything here including
the Whiz Bang—and in this connection permit
an old farmer the privilege of remarking that
the leading California news distributors,
Egbert Brothers, tell me the little old Banger
leads all 25-cent magazines in California in the
matter of circulation.</p>

<p>So Robbinsdale is on the map in California
even if we don’t call our hen-coops “Renaissance
architecture” and our dog-houses “Colonial
garages.”</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">We landed in Los Angeles just in time
to plunk down in the center of a quarrel
between expert fanatics and the motion
picture people. A flock of moonbeam-chasing
neurasthenic preachers insist that evil was not
brought into the world by the serpent in Eden
but was created by Thomas Edison, who invented
the motion picture machine.</p>

<p>The latest synthetic scheme of the reformers
calls for Los Angeles censorship for every
picture manufactured and exhibited in the city.
If the “long hairs” get away with it—and we
don’t think they will—it will be a huge moral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
victory. Los Angeles youth will then be limited
to such amusement as may be gleaned from
shooting craps, joy-riding, dancing at road-houses,
poker and looking for one’s umbrella.</p>

<p>This umbrella story has spinach on it, but
in small towns like Robbinsdale it is still good.
Has to do with the church-goer who arose hurriedly
and left the church as the pastor was in
the midst of reading the Ten Commandments.
He explained to the pastor afterward that it
had just been recalled to his memory where he
had left his umbrella.</p>

<p>However, we didn’t travel all the way out
to California to find our umbrella—or to lose
one—and it is nobody’s business except our old
Minneapolis friend, Dick Ferris, if we did.
Dick is living at the Alex in Los Angeles and
is one of Southern California’s most popular
and esteemed citizens. Dick has begun bobbing
his hair since his early days in Minneapolis,
but says that if hair was brains an old-fashioned
parlor sofa would be vice president.</p>

<p>Dick is one of the best entertainers in the
Southland. One can step inside the “Ferris
Harem” almost any time of day or night and
meet anybody from “diggers of the ditches” to
the “dignitaries of the ducats.”</p>

<p>Roscoe Sarles, famous race driver; Bill
Pickens, Barney Oldfield’s old manager; Julian
Eltinge, the actor; Harry Grayson, sports
editor of the Express; “Scotty” Chisholm, golf
editor and star; King Young, publicity director<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
for Kathrine MacDonald’s pictures; Ham
Beall, another publicity director extraordinary;
Bob Henderson, wealthy oil operator and owner
of the most beautiful home I have ever spilled
ashes in—these are only a few of the legion
of good fellows with whom I had the pleasure
of swapping stories at the Ferris chateau.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">And speaking of stories, I attended a
Motion Picture Press Agents’ banquet
and heard a good one on the reformers.
According to the story, Rev. Wilbur F. Crafts
was addressing an audience of the hoi poili and
he started off bombastically like this: “You
cigar suckers; you cigarette suckers; you pipe
suckers—” At this juncture a tenor voice in
the rear of the hall sung out: “Hey, Doc, you
ain’t going to forget us, are you?” Evidently
a willy boy with an all-day sucker in his hand.</p>

<p>Getting back to Dick Ferris, the former
Minneapolis theatrical magnate, is head of a
big taxi concern and on the side is a “promoting
fool.” Rummaging around in one of Dick’s
dresser drawers, I ran across a box containing
a pair of white silk pajamas. Inside was a card
which, in feminine scrawl, informed Dick that
they were to be worn when “Alone—and Feeling
Blue.” Dick hasn’t been able to wear them—says
he hasn’t felt blue since Mt. Lassen was
a small hill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">During our busy two weeks in Los Angeles
we found time to accept invitations
to inspect several motion picture studios,
among them Universal City and the Katherine
MacDonald studio. Miss MacDonald is a very
charming and very good-looking young woman—and
we feel sorry that such estimable young
artists as Miss MacDonald, Miss Bebe Daniels
and others must suffer some of the reflected
criticism that is brought against the motion
picture colony by the antics of some of the
lame-brained and low-browed satyrs and
satellites.</p>

<p>Out at Universal, Director Eddie Laemmle
grabbed a picture of us in a wild-west scene—a
Minnesota farmer entirely surrounded by
cowboys and “Injuns.”</p>

<p>While in the south I also enjoyed a trip to
Tia Juana, the Mexican Monte Carlo, just
across the border from San Diego. Started to
fly down from Rogers’ airport in Los Angeles,
but had to confine my aerial pilgrimage to a
jaunt over the city and beaches. They don’t
allow American planes to fly across the border
because there is so much booze running.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">Through the good offices of the Oil King
of Breckenridge, Texas, Bob Henderson,
it was our fortune to meet Vice Admiral
Wm. Shoemaker. We were gathered in Bob’s
magnificent home in Los Angeles, formerly occupied
by Mary Pickford and Mary Miles Minter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
(on the q. t., folks, you’ll have to admit it
was pretty soft for a decrepit old Robbinsdale
farmer) indulging in the ornery duties of testing
the champagny contents of Robert’s cellar.</p>

<p>It was while the sparkling bubbles bubbled
that the subject of a visit to Admiral Shoemaker’s
Pacific fleet bobbed up. Next day we
received a personal invitation from the Admiral,
who insisted that we board his barge at
the San Pedro dock. On the Red River of the
North my Dad hauled wheat for the Northern
Pacific railroad in a barge and not having been
on speaking terms with naval language I
assumed that a barge was a heluvan ugly looking
thing.</p>

<p>Imagine my surprise, please, when the bare-foot
jackies heaved ho with an immaculate
launch with three golden stars. Pretty soft
for a hardened old rascal, I claim. We rolled
on to the Flagship “Pennsylvania” and were
greeted by the Admiral’s aide, Lieut. L. S.
Lewis. It was my first view of a battleship
and at once I was impressed with the fact that
the “Pennsylvania” probably could have licked
any of the numerous boats that father once
owned on the Red River. I was surprised to
learn that the 14-inch guns I had read about
were really about 40 feet long instead of 14
inches.</p>

<p>Anyway, we had a delightful time aboard
the “Pennsylvania” and it was the first time
in my life I ever cussed Josephus Daniels <sup>(say it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
sweet and low: “gawsch darn him”)</sup> I had to drink tea.
But the Admiral was a wonderful fellow—hale,
hearty and well met. We exchanged anecdotes
and spent a grand, though dry afternoon.
Lieutenant Lewis and his crew of noblemen
returned us to the dock in the starry BARGE.</p>

<p>Now in the day of retrospection I fain would
believe that the Admiral or his aide must have
been in collusion with the “Pennsylvania” gobs
because every last one of them either was bare-footed
or reading Sam Clark’s Jim Jam Jems
or the little old Banger. Wonderful fellows,
these jackies, but the pesky cusses just insisted
on looking onward and upward (mostly upward)
when the fairly formed feminines in the
party mounted from deck to deck. They just
couldn’t control their naughty eyes. Possibly
it had something to do with Bull of the Durham,
for I am told that the sailor boys love
to roll their own.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">Now, Gentle Readers of this journal of
uplift, I have one little wee surprise for
you. Gus, my old time hired man, who
jumped the job two months ago, located and
surprised me at the Alexandria. Gus is a
pestiferous cuss and has the faculty of bobbing
up at the crucial moment. My “supply” had
given out and promptly, even more promptly
than had been his will to paint boats at Breezy
Point Lodge, he supplied the missing medicine.
It was “terrible stuff” but with the sailor boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
I’ll say—Any port in a storm. His juniper
juice created a tempest within me but I was
glad nevertheless once again to shake the hoary
hand of toil.</p>

<p>In parting I slipped Gus a five simoleon
note. He whispered that he was “on the rocks”
and hadn’t worked since he left Minnesota.
We then and there entered into a gentleman’s
agreement that he never again would work for
me unless his duties would be solely acting as
Indian guide at Breezy Point at a wage of
nothing—except the maternal or fraternal
friendship of Maggie, our cook. Gus loves
Maggie, I think, but better still, he loves her
flapjacks.</p>

<p>Adios to you, Gustav, and here’s hoping I
don’t see you till the fishing season next spring.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">Just one more drop or so before turning
off the tap. It happened to be my good
luck to be invited by Bill Eltinge, better
known in the theatrical world as Julian, to attend
a stag party in honor of the Los Angeles
and Vernon baseball teams at the Maier brewery
in Los Angeles. Doc Stone was master of
ceremonies and he treated us lonely two hundred
homeless and wifeless old stags in a royal
manner. From a purely personal standpoint
there was but one action that marred the entire
evening. After being entertained to a realistic
view of the grand canyon and a wonderful
dance performed by Slim Summerfield and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Bobby Dunn of the Fox studio, the right honorable
toastmaster called on “Captain Billy
Whiz Bang” to recitate. Imagine a rube farmer
trying to spread the fertilizer over the rathskeller
of an up-to-date Loz Onglaz brewery.
Impossible, I’ll say.</p>

<p>Here I had been trying all evening to “put
on the dog” with Frank Chance of Cub fame
next to me, Julian Eltinge, world renowned
actor, to my right, Dick Ferris, best known
privateer in the public eye in front of me, not
to mention such luminaries as Bill Essick,
Wade Killifer, Larry McGraw and Jack Milligan
all around. Then there was “Shine”
Scott doing the honors back of the “near” beer
bar, and “Shine” is well known to every ball
player on the Pacific Coast. Oh, by the way, I
certainly cannot overlook the immortal Tod
Sloan. Either I followed Tod or he followed
me because it was my good fortune to drink
Manhattans with him in the Sunset Inn at Tia
Juana and near beer near here.</p>

<p>Now, readers, to tell the truth, it’s quite
trying to write about this wonderful party
while the writer has a perfectly good Scotch
highball on the desk beside him. (Here goes
another “Happy Day.”)</p>

<p>One must, as one says, review one’s bunk
to see where one’s left off. Talk about Southern
hospitality, well, give me the Coast. Anyway,
I never made the speech. How could I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
after Eltinge had brought tears of joy to members
of this famous gathering?</p>

<p>Like the lowly backward shyster of pedigreed
bull that I am, I failed to carry out the
principles of my “deah” old friend Volstead.
(This effort calls for one Scotch heeball.) So
I walked upon the brewery stage. And when
I made my bow I’ll tell you one thing which
every ball player and umpire of Southern California
will verify. The stein of near beer was
clutched fondly in my sturdy right hand.</p>

<p>It was a rotten speech—in fact, no speech at
all. My Los Angeles physician had prescribed
that I take “one tablespoonful in milk every
hour.” The milkman and my watch both went
hay-wire.</p>

<p>But I had a good time—an elegant time and
awakened next day with fond remembrances of
the morning after the night before.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">There are still a few rumbling in San
Francisco regarding Arbuckle and his
now famous party. The stories they tell
are wonderful to listen to by way of teaching
us farmers what strange means certain persons
have devised to get a kick out of life.</p>

<p>For instance, as my friend Barney Google
would say, take this little “roomer”:</p>

<p>Two of the numerous members of the party
decided to entertain their guests—the party
was “dragging” as it were. The form of entertainment
provided so I am told, was the kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
few of us number among our accomplishments.
Somehow or other, we have never gotten over
that old-fashioned idea that certain ceremonies
listed in the regular catalog or otherwise, are
not for an audience. Rather, they are for
occasions dedicated solely to the gods and ourselves.</p>

<p>And then there was another. That when
certain restrictive measures were indulged in,
the Arbuckle counsel had it whispered about
that should things get too strong, the defense
might allow the names of certain men and
women, socially prominent in San Francisco,
to be introduced as possible witnesses to testify
as to the actual happenings.</p>

<p>Needless to say, the well known Mr. and
Mrs. Consternation immediately entered upon
the scene.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">And there was Captain Al Waddell, who
commanded a battery in our late fracas.
Al is the boy who made a hero out of
Cliff Durant out here—really put over the son
of the “Master Mind” of the automotive world,
W. C. Durant. Al, who knows everybody and
everything in California, might have made a
fortune in writing a Hearst feature about the
Durant divorce—but he’s too busy selling the
Perfecto two-speed axles for Fords—whatever
they may be.</p>

<p>It seems that for six years young Cliff had
been telling his wife what to do. When he returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
from an important conference in New
York with his dad, who was still president of
the General Motors, she calmly announced:</p>

<p>“For six years I’ve been listening to you tell
me what to do. Now for six seconds just listen
to me tell you what to do.” The inside of the
bomb contained these sweet tidings: “Just give
me one-half of what you own.”</p>

<p>Since Cliff was worth eight or ten millions,
you’ll advise it was disastrous news from the
front, inasmuch as she “made it stick.”</p>

<p>And now, so the story goes, Cliff won’t have
to worry and fret about any mysterious looking
gentleman coming to stop at his hotel at
Le Bec when he blows in.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">There’s another echo from the town of
fogs and poodle dogs that doesn’t ring
of Robbinsdale.</p>

<p>Just shortly after that infamous Howard
Street Gangsters affair the police raided a
“Love Nest.” It seems that, regardless of race,
creed or color (or sex) you indulged your favorite
diversion while in the “Love Nest” with
your neighbor. Inasmuch as minors were involved,
there was another “Roman holiday”
expected for those who would crowd the
prisons. Just when they were getting ready
to point thumbs down, the defense asked for
continuance. “And on what grounds?” demanded
the prosecution.</p>

<p>“So that we may bring witnesses—women of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
high social rank in the city—to testify, by way
of the indisputable means of photographs, that
my clients are nothing more than artistic
photographers, specializing in taking photos of
women in the nude.”</p>

<p>It is a rather singular fact that the continuance
was granted, that little more was
heard about the case and that instead of being
sent to San Quentin for fifty years the defendants
got off with light sentences.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Running across old friends is one of the
best things you do on these jamborees.
Here in ’Frisco I found two old Minneapolis
Journal men holding down important
jobs—Jim Callahan, now business manager of
the Examiner and generally considered one of
Hearst’s “right hand” men, and Chris Helin,
manager of The Examiner’s Automobile Department.
I am sorry to say that they are both
back sliders and wouldn’t trade the nip of the
peninsula for half of Minnesota.</p>

<p>Funny how these fellows go loco when they
reach California. Really, folks, you wouldn’t
expect your friends to try to sell you real
estate, would you?</p>

<p class="dropcap">My visit to San Francisco was the first
since 1904, when I came home from doing
my Spanish-American war “bit” in
the Philippines. She’s a different city since
the fire. California is a great state for new
building—buildings going up here and everywhere.
Among other enterprises they are
building a lot of old missions, I understand.</p>

<p>Saw a sign over a Mission street doorway
reading: “Virtue &amp; Co., Ltd.” It used to be
“unlimited” here back in the Dupont street days
in 1904, but I thought that had all gone with
Barbary Coast.</p>

<h3>An Opulent Love Letter!</h3>

<p>Oh, dearie! just the lucid thought of your
love, yes just to think of it fills my combined
heart and soul with the most limpid fulgency.
Every time I think of you my erotic pumping
organ vibrates all through my body. It is just
your love that keeps my soul from sacrifice. One
minute I imagine you are exulting your thought
on me in the most wonderful way, and then I
feel, Oh, so strong and lusty, and it encounters
the greatest exultation of my life, but before
I know it the door flies open and the entire
thought escapes without impetus, and then the
next thing to come is a thought rather much
undesirable.</p>

<p>I just imagine you think very little of me
and that you are keeping it concealed just to
see how jejune you can drain my poor heart
from that pure living love of yours, and, Oh!
it makes me feel so impotent that I want to loll
my life away. It is just the lack of your levity
that hurts, and my heart turns gelid and cold
but after I carry that muse for a minute then
the most mellifluous thought comes to my mind
telling me that you are thinking of me in the
most elegant way and my eyes fly wide open
with fraught fulgency and I feel as though I
am floating on a lovely pink cloud eating ice
cream smothered in violets, and Oh!</p>

<p>An Irishman, who was very drunk, was riding
on the back platform of an old-fashioned
trolley car, and with every pitch and swerve
he would sway and nearly fall off. The conductor’s
warning to be seated inside were
waived aside with “I’m all right.”</p>

<p>Soon the car swung around a curve where
the bank was steep and rocky. The Irishman
swayed and pitched head-long down the bank,
being badly bruised and knocked unconscious.
While being carried back up the bank he
regained consciousness and asked: “Was anyone
hurt in the wreck?”</p>

<p>“There wasn’t any wreck,” replied the

<h2><i>The City of Lost Angels</i></h2>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>The following article, written by Rev. Golightly Morrill,
was inspired by a tour he made of the movie camps two
years ago. We cannot agree that Rev. Morrill’s description
fits the present day Hollywood and Los Angeles. Indeed,
we found the situation quite pleasing. It is true that Los
Angeles is brimful of wim, wigor and witality, and why
shouldn’t it be? If one was to take a thousand of the world’s
most beautiful women and implant them on Robbinsdale’s
virgin soil, or in any other town, Rev. Morrill would find
as much to scorch his burning pen. So before you read this,
gentle reader, let’s give three cheers for California.—The
Editor.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="by">BY REV. “GOLIGHTLY” MORRILL</p>

<p class="center">Pastor, People’s Church, Minneapolis, Minn.</p>

<p class="dropcap">One night I went out from Los Angeles
with my moral telescope to make some
observations in the movie firmament.
Music was playing, but the Muse of Music
would never recognize it. In Collins’ Ode,
Music was a “heavenly maid,” played in Greece
and was Wisdom’s aid, chaste and sublime—perhaps,
but not here. It was jazz gone drunk
and crazy, to the great delight of prodigal sons
and daughters.</p>

<p>Through clouds of cigarette smoke I saw
the movie stars. These “heavenly bodies” have
very earthly souls. Some were fixed stars at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
tables, others falling into partners’ arms, and
shooting stars were shooting love glances at
each other. Some other stars seemed votaries
of Astarte, the licentious goddess to whom a
temple has been erected in Hollywood, where
I was entertained by a French countess, who
regaled me with tea, fresh cakes and a veritable
Madame de Stael (not stale) vivacious conversation
on travel, music, art, literature and
religion. Although she was French, I fully
understood her good English accent and
gesture, as I did the meaning of her charming
sister who went to the piano and sang, “I love
you.” Morals and movies are not inseparable.
Hollywood is the modern Daphne Grove where
the Seventh of the Ten Commandments is frequently
forgotten or erased.</p>

<p>Southern California, the “land of the flea,”
is also an artists’ paradise. The paint most
advertised is cosmetics. The dearest paintings
I noticed were those walking on the streets.
The Angelenos are expert painters of scenery
and theatre signs, of auto bodies, and of their
own faces with liquor. But why is art necessary
at all? They have climate, and that
divides the honor with charity in covering a
multitude of sins. Nature has placed all California
artists in the shade by placing on her
easel the matchless pieces of sea, field and
mountain. Practical art is found in the “drawings”
of gold ore from the soil and money
from the pockets of the speculators. The water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
color is irrigation that turns the brown earth
green. The “oil” is petroleum from which
modern mining masters are making millions
compared with the price the oils of the old masters
bring. Murder is one of the fine arts of Los
Angeles, promoted by autos which assume the
pedestrian has no rights and deliberately
knock him right and left and leave him bruised
and bleeding. The trouble is not so much wine
as auto-intoxication. There is an auto to every
thirteen inhabitants, which may account for so
many unlucky accidents. The auto roads in
the state are the finest in the world. They
can’t be called “rotten” even though they are
made from decomposed granite.</p>

<p>Most attractive are the beaches near Los
Angeles. Here caterpillar trams crawl along,
sidewalks which swarm with gum-chewers,
popcorn-munchers, gingerale-guzzlers, peanut-masticators,
hawkers of red hot dogs, spitters
of tobacco, ice cream cone venders, stylish
freaks and freakish styles, nice and naughty
men, good and bad girls, and roller skaters. I
grew dizzy at Ferris wheels, aeroplanes, rollercoasters,
the plunge bath of the great unwashed,
pavilions of dirt, drink, dancing and
dissipation. Over all there hung a Cologne
variety of smells. Couples were swinging in
pier dance halls to ragtime orchestras. There
were high dives in the water, and low dives on
the street where the innocent were doped,
debauched and robbed. Noise was raised to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
nth power. Instead of the sweet sea breeze
there was the strong aroma of popcorn and
perspiration.</p>

<p>At the beach you discover many things
Columbus never found in his travels—peanut
shells, dippy dippers, tin cans, can cans, tin
horn sports, human lobsters and jelly fish, shell
games, gulls and gullibles, papers, lunch boxes,
bags, flasks, mermaids, mere men, kids with
pails and shovels, playmates, families, spoony
couples, kelp, garters, dead fish, fishermen,
lines, nets, boats, cottages, hotels, resorts,
boardwalks, promenades, bare legs, arms, feet,
busts, driftwood and piers. Here one can find
lost souls without exploring the shores of
Phlegethon, Cocytus and Avernus.</p>

<p>L. A.’s Elysium Park is like the classic one
in one respect. When Aeneas went through the
Elysian fields all the objects were clothed in a
purple light—here it is the haze from innumerable
autos whose exhausts wrap everything
in smoky pall and smell. The park is a good
place to spend hours with the Houris, and to
keep it from being a Paradise Lost, one is
prohibited from spending the night there.
Many enact here the myths of the nymphs and
satyrs. Holiday guests are often found “star-scattered”
on the grass, acting out the
Rubaiyat.</p>

<p>There is only one “Lost” Angeles in all the
world.</p>

of which his hearers were guilty and
enlarge upon the danger of spending eternity
in a warm but insalubrious climate, the poor
Irishman felt that he was “hair hung and
breeze shaken over hell” as Elder Means said.
Soon he was under deep “conviction” and in
due time was soundly converted.</p>

<p>A few evenings later he arose to give his
“testimony” and said: “Ladies and gintlemen;
Oh, Oi beg yer pardon—My Dear Sisters an’
Brothers; you know Oi’m not used to spakin’

<h3>The Bray of An Ass</h3>

<p>The man who had left the door open closed
it and then, dropping into a seat, buried his
face in his hands and began to weep. The big
man looked somewhat uncomfortable and, rising
finally walked up to the weeper and tapped him
on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“My friend,” he said, “I didn’t intend to hurt

door.”</p>

<p>The man who was weeping raised his head
and grinned. “Old man,” he said, “I am not
crying because you hurt my feelings, but because
you asked me if I was raised in a barn.
The fact is that I was raised in a barn, and
every time I hear an ass bray it makes me
homesick.”</p>

<p class="by">“<i>The Bull is Mightier Than the Bullet.</i>”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">There are many “Calamity Janes” in the
U. S. A. One of their stock cries, just
after a crime has been committed is, “If
she gets off, she’s going in the movies!”</p>

<p>Let us look at the real facts. Searching the
history of the moving picture business, in not a
single instance has a murder been starred in
pictures.</p>

<p>About seven or eight years ago a wealthy
married man in Virginia was shot by his wife
(or was it by a girl in the case?)—Beulah
Binford—because he had trifled with her affections.
The courts proved the man a rotter,
and because Beulah was a very young girl, she
was released without a prison sentence.
Beulah’s heart and life were broken and she
wanted to bury herself in her little home town
and try to start over again, but she needed
money. An unscrupulous promoter from New
York who thought he could profit by the
notoriety caused by the crime, made her an
offer to be starred in pictures. Beulah went to
New York. The picture was taken but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
police closed Madison Square Garden when it
was scheduled to show there. Even in those
early days of picturedom, movie companies of
any standing were bitterly incensed against
promoters who wanted to make money by
exploiting crime.</p>

<p>The tragic figure in this case was Beulah
Binford herself. When the picture failed to
bring in receipts she was left alone and
penniless in a strange city. She went from
studio to studio asking for work, but despite
the fact that she was beautiful, no one wanted
to take a chance with her. Finally the Republic
Film Company, of New York, gave her a job
sorting papers in their office. She went
through countless hardships in the city. What
has become of her, we do not know.</p>

<p>A few years later, in Wisconsin, a boy
student killed his sweetheart in a lonely wooded
section not far from the state university
buildings. The case was never proved to have
been premeditated murder and he was not given
a prison sentence. A well known New York
syndicate writer, a woman went out to
Wisconsin and tied up the boy’s services for
pictures. She then hastened back to New York
to sell the contract for a profit. Every picture
company in New York turned down her
proposition to star the boy!</p>

<p>After Marie Edwards shot Senator Lyons
a year or so ago in California, she visited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
all the studios in Los Angeles in an attempt
to get into the movies. Not a single position
was offered her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Louise Peete, who was recently
sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder
of J. C. Denton at his home in Los Angeles,
made overtures to the picture companies during
the time she thought she was going to be freed.
Not a single studio executive paid the slightest
attention to her attempts to be exploited on
the screen.</p>

<p>The “son” of Senator New, who brutally
killed his sweetheart in Topanga Canyon near
Los Angeles about a year ago, also thought he
might follow a picture career, but this was cut
short when he was sentenced to twenty years
in the penitentiary.</p>

<p>Mrs. Marie Bailey, who shot her sweetheart,
Clarence Hogan, in Pasadena last December,
told all reporters that she was going to be
featured in pictures as soon as she was
released. Mrs. Bailey had previously played
in pictures, but when she was arrested, picture
studios all made the notation that she would
never again be hired even as an “extra.” Marie
has gone “up” for ten years.</p>

<p>The Clara Hamon picture, “Fate,” although
already produced, has not been exhibited in
the theatres. In the light of the history of past
cases has it a chance?</p>

<p class="dropcap">An authority once established is hard
to controvert. That is why it is going to
be one heck of a job to knock any kind of
a dent into the present Volstead law prohibiting
even a smelling acquaintance with wine, beer or
regular hard “licker.” Organized minorities
vote solidly in politics; the vote of the majority
is scattered. There is nothing more easily
swayed than popular opinion and popular
“passion” with the right kind of propaganda.</p>

<p>I remember when Carpentier, the French
fight champ, came across to get his bump on the
beak, Gus and I were discussing the antics of
the New York society women who “literally”
fought with each other for the privilege of
kissing him at a garden party. It is the human
nature of the female of the specie to kiss the
male brute at every opportune occasion, and,
under stress of easily aroused emotions, under
other conditions as well.</p>

<p>Emotion is a primitive human instinct and
if women swarm to kiss a prize fighter in these
enlightened days, it is easy to understand how
an unorganized majority of males, as well as
females, might be moulded by proper
propaganda to a conviction that this country
will go to the bow wows unless booze of all
character and description is kicked into the
discard.</p>

<p>We must admit that the prohibition minority
did not slip anything over on the majority
when it wasn’t looking. First they sneaked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
into a few legislatures and then they put it
through Congress and had it ratified by their
legislatures. The majority found out about it
when it was too late. All the majority can do
now is to defy the Volstead law and vote down
the enforcement provisions of it. Some of
them are doing this—while others are becoming
Cunard addicts and going to Europe and
Havana.</p>

<p>Europe used to be a continent of kings—now
it is only America’s corner saloon.</p>

<p>We have never held any particular briefs
for Squirrel whisky and other forms of 100
proof “hootch.” But even our former president,
Woodrow—what was his name?—Wilson, is
strong for wines and beers and we are willing
to stack with him on this question, at least. It
is going to be a hard job—getting any
concessions from the prohibitionists. We believe
Gus has the right idea, however, when he says
the day of the “bum voyage” to Europe is
nearing a close, and that the old familiar sign
“Wines, Liquors and Segars” may soon be
dusted off and tacked up outside the front door.</p>

<h2><i>Smokehouse Poetry</i></h2>

</div>

<p><i>Every once in a while we get regular he-man verse
prompted by dreams in some feather bed, but from the pen
of Budd L. McKillips, Whiz Bang readers again are to be
treated with a poem inspired by real life. In the Winter
Annual of the Whiz Bang we reproduced Mr. McKillips’
poem “After the Raid,” inspired while Mr. McKillips, as a
newspaper reporter, “covered” story of the raid on the
National Dutch Room cabaret in Minneapolis. Recently
pretty Zelda Crosby, picture scenario writer, of New York,
committed suicide in a hotel by drinking poison, as a result
of a prominent film magnate spurning her after teaching her
the ways of love and folly. This magnate, like many other
alleged reformers, has been a leading figure in the movement
for purity in pictures. The title of Mr. McKillips
poem, written exclusively for the Whiz Bang, is “The Girl
From Over ‘There’.” In addition to that poem we are publishing
a crackerjack rival to the “Gila Monster Route,” with
which Winter Annual readers have fallen in love, called
“The Blanket Stiff.”</i></p>

<p class="dropcap">At several recent parties and dinners
attended by film stars and given since
the Arbuckle affair has been disclosed,
the picture people have not refused cocktails
or wine offered by the host. The picture people
have been drinking their cocktails with a bit of
defiance as if to show the world that “there are
plenty of us who can drink with moderation
and do nothing to hurt our neighbor or disgrace
the community.”</p>

<p>Before prohibition made such conditions
imperative, all of us might have thought the
party a bit too free and careless if drinks were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
served in hotel bedrooms and prelude parties
to hotel dinners given on the upper floors. For
those who still believe in the free rights of the
individual, hotel bedroom drinking is the only
kind allowed by law. Perhaps if the Arbuckle
party had been allowed to order their drinks
in a hotel lobby or tea-room, the tragedy of
Miss Rappe’s death would never have occurred.</p>

<p>At any rate, let it be said that at two large
dinner parties given since the Arbuckle affair,
the film people drank with decorum and several
Pasadena and Los Angeles millionaire society
men were the ones laid out to “rest and recuperate!”</p>

yacht equipped with “orchid and rose suites,”
promising to border on the near dangerous, was

stars. The party took place without the film
folk, there being plenty of fast folk in the

life and if he couldn’t live it there, he would
